# affected:dep-graph

Graph dependencies affected by changes

## Usage

```bash
nx affected:dep-graph
```

Install `@nrwl/cli` globally to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npm run nx` or `yarn nx`.

### Examples

Open the dep graph of the workspace in the browser, and highlight the projects affected by changing the index.ts file:

```bash
nx affected:dep-graph --files=libs/mylib/src/index.ts
```

Open the dep graph of the workspace in the browser, and highlight the projects affected by the changes between master and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected:dep-graph --base=master --head=HEAD
```

Save the dep graph of the workspace in a json file, and highlight the projects affected by the changes between master and HEAD (e.g., PR):

```bash
nx affected:dep-graph --base=master --head=HEAD --file=output.json
```

Open the dep graph of the workspace in the browser, and highlight the projects affected by the last commit on master:

```bash
nx affected:dep-graph --base=master~1 --head=master
```
