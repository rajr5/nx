# dep-graph

Graph dependencies within workspace

## Usage

```bash
nx dep-graph
```

[Install `nx` globally]({{framework}}/getting-started/nx-setup#install-nx) to invoke the command directly using `nx`, or use `npx nx`, `yarn nx`, or `pnpx nx`.

### Examples

Open the dep graph of the workspace in the browser:

```bash
nx dep-graph
```

Save the dep graph into a json file:

```bash
nx dep-graph --file=output.json
```

Generate a static website with dep graph into an html file, accompanied by an asset folder called static:

```bash
nx dep-graph --file=output.html
```

Show the graph where every node is either an ancestor or a descendant of todos-feature-main:

```bash
nx dep-graph --focus=todos-feature-main
```

Include project-one and project-two in the dep graph:

```bash
nx dep-graph --include=project-one,project-two
```

Exclude project-one and project-two from the dep graph:

```bash
nx dep-graph --exclude=project-one,project-two
```

Show the graph where every node is either an ancestor or a descendant of todos-feature-main, but exclude project-one and project-two:

```bash
nx dep-graph --focus=todos-feature-main --exclude=project-one,project-two
```

Watch for changes to dep graph and update in-browser:

```bash
nx dep-graph --watch
```
