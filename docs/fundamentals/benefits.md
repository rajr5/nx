# Productivity

Nx helps your team move quickly when setting up enterprise Angular applications by providing a default setup for complex projects. It adds the monorepo-style development to the Angular CLI, which enables fast project development, team collaboration, and code reuse. Nx also provides runtime libraries to simplify complex tasks with state management and testing, so developers can spend more time implementing features and less time wrestling with setup and testing. Finally, Nx provides an easy path for otherwise complex tasks, such as setting up AngularJS upgrade in hybrid mode for an iterative approach to upgrading applications.

# Consistency

Out of the box, Angular CLI follows the Angular style guide and helps enforce patterns and practices within application folder/file structure, naming conventions, component organization and more, providing a good foundation for most applications. Nx builds on the foundation provided by Angular CLI, and provides a more opinionated architecture, which allows Nx to provide more advanced code generation and analysis. With stronger conventions around code organization and state management in place, teams are able to share more knowledge, code, and infrastructure.

# Safety

The contributors to Nx have worked with many teams building massive Angular applications, and have found common mistakes and antipatterns which can lead to race conditions, performance issues, or code maintainability challenges. Fortunately, many of these mistakes can be identified by static analysis at development time.
