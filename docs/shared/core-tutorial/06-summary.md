# Core Nx Tutorial - Step 6: Summary

In this tutorial you:

- Built a blog using Eleventy
- Built a CLI with Go
- Shared asset files between projects
- Used Nx's computation caching to never build the same code twice
- Used Nx's affected commands to only rebuild affected projects
- Used Nx's ability to automatically detect dependencies between js/ts projects

You created a workspace from scratch in this tutorial, but if you would like to add Nx to an existing repository, you can use the `npx add-nx-to-monorepo` terminal command to get started. For more information see the [Adding Nx to Lerna/Yarn/PNPM/NPM Workspace](migration/adding-to-monorepo) guide.
