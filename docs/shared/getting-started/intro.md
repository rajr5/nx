# Intro to Nx

Nx is a smart, fast and extensible build system with first class monorepo support and powerful integrations.

## Philosophy

Nx shares the design philosophy with Visual Studio Code. Code is a powerful text editor, and you can be very productive
with it even if you don't install any extensions. The ecosystem of VSCode's extensions though is what can really level
up your productivity.

Nx is similar. The core of Nx is generic, simple, and unobtrusive. Nx plugins, although very useful for many projects,
are completely optional.

Most examples on this site use Nx plugins. It's just easier to demonstrate many features Nx offers when Nx generates all
the boilerplate. The vast majority of the features though will work the same way in a workspace with no plugins.
