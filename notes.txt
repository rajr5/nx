1. nx build web (find the set of tasks it needs to run)
2. for each task it will compute the hash
3.   it checks if the outputs are already in the right place
4.     it checks the cache (local and then remote)
5.       run it and store it the cache
6. Nx Cloud provides remote caching


Use static serve to max cache hits:
nx serve myapp (they run webpack-dev-server)
nx serve-static myapp (build + http-server dist)

Imagine you don't have serve-static:
nx affected --target=build & nx affected --target=e2e

If you have static serve:
nx affected --target=build && nx affected --target=e2e
nx affected --target=e2e (where e2e has a dependOn on static-serve/build)

Your case is perfect for caching :)


Distribution is the only way to make your CI really fast consistenlty.
