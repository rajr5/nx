# Angular Plugin for Nx

The Nx Plugin for Angular contains executors, generators, and utilities for managing Angular applications, and libraries within an Nx workspace. It provides:

- Integration with libraries such as Jest, Cypress, Karma, Protractor, and Storybook.
- Helper services, and functions to use along with NgRx libraries.
- Scaffolding for upgrading AngularJS applications.
- Scaffolding for creating buildable libraries that can be published to npm.
- Utilities for automatic workspace refactoring.

## Adding the Angular plugin

Adding the Angular plugin to a workspace can be done with the following:

```bash
#yarn
yarn add @nrwl/angular
```

```bash
#npm
npm install @nrwl/angular
```

For more information about the `@nrwl/angular` package take a look at the [Angular Plugin Overview](https://nx.dev/l/a/angular/overview).

```

### Serving Application

- Run `nx serve myapp` to serve the newly generated application!
- Run `nx test myapp` to test it.
- Run `nx e2e myapp-e2e` to run e2e tests for it.

You can also use `ng` instead of `nx`:

- Run `ng serve myapp` to serve the newly generated application!
- Run `ng test myapp` to test it.
- Run `ng e2e myapp-e2e` to run e2e tests for it.
