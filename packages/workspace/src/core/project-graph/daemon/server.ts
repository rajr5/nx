/**
 * For IPC with with the daemon server we use unix sockets or windows pipes, depending on the user's operating system.
 * Further notes on the cross-platform concerns are covered below.
 *
 * Unix:
 *
 * - The path is a filesystem pathname. It gets truncated to an OS-dependent length of sizeof(sockaddr_un.sun_path) - 1.
 * Typical values are 107 bytes on Linux and 103 bytes on macOS.
 * - A Unix domain socket will be visible in the filesystem and will persist until unlinked
 *
 * Windows:
 *
 * - The local domain is implemented using a named pipe. The path must refer to an entry in \\?\pipe\ or \\.\pipe\.
 * - Unlike Unix domain sockets, Windows will close and remove the pipe when the owning process exits.
 *
 * We create the socket/pipe based on a path within the current workspace so that we maintain one unique daemon per
 * workspace to ensure that subtle differences between Nx workspaces cannot cause issues.
