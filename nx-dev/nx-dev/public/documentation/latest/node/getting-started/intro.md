## Philosophy

Nx is built on a technology agnostic core that maintains modular units of code and understands the dependency graph between them. Developers comprehend that your app contains two pages that each use a shared button component. Nx uses this same knowledge to provide insights and performance improvements. There's a whole ecosystem of plugins that build on this foundation.

Nx becomes more valuable as you scale, solving problems that are frustrating for small teams, but paralyzing for large teams.

Nx works especially well for monorepos. Each new app added to a monorepo provides more opportunities to share code and tooling but that often comes at the cost of a compounding slowdown in the CI pipeline. Nx ensures that adding another app to the repo does not increase the existing appâ€™s test or build time.
